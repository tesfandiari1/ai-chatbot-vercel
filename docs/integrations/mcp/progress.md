## MCP Integration Plan

### Overview of Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables seamless integration between AI applications and external data sources or tools. It provides a standardized way for LLMs to connect with and retrieve information from various systems, allowing AI to access real-time data rather than relying solely on its pre-trained knowledge.

Key features of MCP include:
- Standardized protocol for AI-data source communication
- Support for tools and function-calling capabilities
- Real-time data access and context management
- Ability to connect to multiple systems through a single interface

The vercel-labs/mcp-on-vercel repository provides a framework for running an MCP server on Vercel's infrastructure, which can complement our existing AI chatbot by enhancing its ability to access external data and tools.

> **Note**: We maintain a reference copy of the `mcp-on-vercel` template in the `/mcp-template` directory. This is for reference purposes only and is not part of the actual implementation. The actual MCP implementation is in `/lib/mcp` and `/api/mcp`. The reference template is excluded from Git tracking.

### Integration Benefits

Integrating MCP into our current AI chatbot will provide several benefits:

1. **Enhanced Context Awareness**: Enable the chatbot to access real-time data and maintain context across multiple interactions.
2. **Expanded Tool Capabilities**: Introduce a standardized approach to tool calling beyond our current implementation.
3. **Improved Data Connectivity**: Allow the chatbot to connect with a wider range of data sources through a unified protocol.
4. **Standardization**: Align with emerging industry standards for AI context management.
5. **Future-Proofing**: Position the chatbot to adopt new data sources and tools as they become available through the MCP ecosystem.

## Identified Issues and Required Fixes

After comparing our implementation with the official MCP TypeScript SDK documentation, we've identified several issues that need to be addressed:

### 1. Server Transport Configuration
- ðŸš¨ **Connection Management Issue**: The current SSE transport implementation using a custom `activeConnections` Map doesn't fully align with documentation examples.
- ðŸ”„ **Fix Required**: Refactor to use the standard pattern shown in SDK documentation for managing multiple simultaneous connections.
- ðŸ“‹ **File**: `lib/mcp/mcp-api-handler.ts`
- âœ… **Status**: Fixed by properly implementing connection tracking and using correct transport setup.

### 2. Error Handling
- ðŸš¨ **Incomplete Error Recovery**: Current implementation lacks comprehensive error recovery mechanisms.
- ðŸ”„ **Fix Required**: Enhance error handling with proper reconnection logic and more granular error responses.
- ðŸ“‹ **Files**: `lib/mcp/mcp-api-handler.ts`, `lib/mcp/client.ts`
- âœ… **Status**: Fixed with improved error handling in both files.

### 3. Redis State Management
- ðŸš¨ **Underutilized Redis**: Redis is initialized but not effectively used for state persistence.
- ðŸ”„ **Fix Required**: Implement proper state management with Redis for conversation context and session data.
- ðŸ“‹ **File**: `lib/mcp/mcp-api-handler.ts`
- âœ… **Status**: Fixed by implementing a manual state management approach with Redis since the SDK doesn't expose direct state handling methods.

### 4. Client Implementation Issues
- ðŸš¨ **Browser Compatibility**: The `window.location.href` usage in client.ts will cause issues in server-side rendering.
- ðŸš¨ **Reconnection Logic**: The client lacks proper reconnection handling for network interruptions.
- ðŸ”„ **Fix Required**: Make client code isomorphic and add reconnection capabilities.
- ðŸ“‹ **File**: `lib/mcp/client.ts`
- âœ… **Status**: Fixed by implementing isomorphic base URL detection and fixing client configuration.

### 5. Tool Implementation
- ðŸš¨ **Limited Tool Set**: Current server only implements a basic echo tool, not the rich set described in progress document.
- ðŸ”„ **Fix Required**: Implement the full range of planned tools following SDK documentation patterns.
- ðŸ“‹ **File**: `api/mcp/server.ts`
- ðŸŸ¡ **Status**: Partially implemented. Basic structure is in place, additional tools will be added as needed.

### 6. Security Considerations
- ðŸš¨ **Limited Authentication**: No proper authentication mechanism for MCP connections.
- ðŸ”„ **Fix Required**: Implement authentication and authorization for MCP server requests.
- ðŸ“‹ **Files**: `lib/mcp/mcp-api-handler.ts`, `api/mcp/server.ts`
- âœ… **Status**: Fixed by implementing token validation for SSE connections.

## Implementation Corrections Made

We've made several important corrections to align our implementation with the MCP TypeScript SDK:

### 1. SSEClientTransport Configuration
The SDK documentation revealed that our client transport configuration was incorrect:
```typescript
// Removed incorrect options:
const transport = new SSEClientTransport(
  new URL(`${serverUrl}/sse`, getBaseUrl())
  // SSEClientTransport doesn't accept the options we were passing
);
```

### 2. Client Connection Configuration 
Fixed client initialization by removing the incorrect transport property:
```typescript
// Removed invalid transport property:
const client = new Client(
  {
    name: 'MCP-Client',
    version: '1.0.0',
  },
  {
    capabilities: {
      resources: {},
      tools: {},
      prompts: {},
    }
  }
);

// Connect separately:
await client.connect(transport);
```

### 3. State Management Approach
The SDK doesn't expose the state management methods we were trying to use:
```typescript
// Removed these incorrect calls:
server.server.onStateChange = async (state) => { await saveState(state); };
server.server.loadState(previousState);

// Implemented manual state tracking instead using Redis
```

### 4. Node.js Import Fixes
Corrected Node.js module imports to use the node: protocol:
```typescript
// Changed:
import crypto from 'crypto';
// To:
import crypto from 'node:crypto';
```

### 5. Token Validation Implementation
Added proper token validation function:
```typescript
async function validateToken(token: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // For development, you can return true or use a simple validation
  // In production, implement proper token validation
  return token === process.env.MCP_AUTH_TOKEN || process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
}
```

## Next Steps

With these fixes implemented, our MCP integration is now much more compliant with the SDK documentation. The following steps remain:

1. **Type Checking**: Run TypeScript checker to ensure all type errors are resolved
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the full connection lifecycle with real data
3. **Tool Implementation**: Expand the tool set as outlined in our plan
4. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to Vercel with proper environment variables

### Next Steps to Start Using MCP

To begin actively using MCP in the application, complete the following steps:

#### 1. Deploy to Production
- Push MCP integration to the Vercel production environment
- Ensure Redis connectivity in the production environment
- Verify environment variables are properly set in Vercel dashboard

#### 2. Add Custom Tools (Implementation Guide)
To add a new tool to the MCP server:

1. Edit `api/mcp/server.ts` to add your tool:
```typescript
// Example: Adding a weather tool
server.tool(
  "getWeather", 
  { location: z.string() }, 
  async ({ location }) => {
    // Implement weather API call here
    const weather = await fetchWeatherData(location);
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Weather in ${location}: ${weather}` }]
    };
  }
);

// Then add it to the capabilities
capabilities: {
  tools: {
    echo: { description: "Echo a message back to the user" },
    getWeather: { description: "Get weather information for a location" }
  }
}
```

2. Create a helper module for your tool (optional but recommended):
```typescript
// lib/mcp/tools/weather.ts
export async function fetchWeatherData(location: string) {
  // Implement weather data fetching
  return "Sunny, 75Â°F";
}
```

#### 3. Integrate with Chat Interface
To connect the MCP client with the chat interface:

1. Import the MCP AI integration:
```typescript
// app/(chat)/chat/page.tsx or appropriate component
import { mcpAI } from '@/lib/mcp/ai-sdk-integration';
```

2. Use MCP in your chat interactions:
```typescript
// Example of using MCP tools in a chat interaction
const handleMessageWithTools = async (message) => {
  // When weather information is needed
  if (message.includes('weather')) {
    const location = extractLocation(message);
    const weatherData = await mcpAI.actions.callTool('getWeather', { location }, conversationId);
    // Use the weatherData in your response
  }
};
```

#### 4. Test and Refine
- Create test cases for each tool
- Monitor Redis usage and performance
- Refine tool implementations based on real usage patterns

#### 5. Extend Functionality (Future Enhancement Ideas)
- **Document Retrieval Tool**: Add capability to search and retrieve documents
- **Database Integration**: Connect to databases for data queries
- **External API Tools**: Integrate with various external APIs for expanded functionality
- **Vector Search**: Implement vector search for semantic context retrieval

## Conclusion

The MCP integration is structurally implemented but requires several fixes to achieve full compliance with the official SDK documentation. By addressing the identified issues and implementing the suggested improvements, we can ensure our MCP integration is robust, scalable, and follows best practices.

The modular architecture we've implemented provides a good foundation, but needs refinement in key areas like error handling, state management, and security. Following the action plan outlined above will help us create a production-ready MCP implementation that enhances our AI chatbot's capabilities.
