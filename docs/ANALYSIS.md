## Abstraction Layer Proposal

To decouple AI function-calling mechanisms from business logic:

1. **Core Abstraction Layer**:
   - Create a unified interface for all AI interactions
   - Abstract provider-specific implementations
   - Provide a pluggable architecture for tools and capabilities

```typescript
// Proposed abstraction interface
interface AIServiceInterface {
  // Core message handling
  sendMessage(message: string, options?: MessageOptions): Promise<AIResponse>;
  
  // Tool registration and management
  registerTool(tool: Tool): void;
  unregisterTool(toolId: string): void;
  
  // Context and state management
  getConversationContext(conversationId: string): Promise<Context>;
  setConversationContext(conversationId: string, context: Context): Promise<void>;
}
```

2. **Tool Abstraction**:
   - Define a standard tool interface with lifecycle hooks
   - Support for tool categorization and discovery
   - Allow for tool composition and dependencies

```typescript
// Proposed tool interface
interface Tool {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: ToolCategory;
  parameters: ToolParameter[];
  execute(params: Record<string, any>, context: ToolContext): Promise<ToolResult>;
  canHandle(intent: string): boolean;
}
```

3. **UI Abstraction**:
   - Decouple UI components from specific AI implementations
   - Create render adapters for different response types
   - Standardize interaction patterns for all AI features

This abstraction approach will:
- Enable easier integration of new AI providers
- Facilitate the addition of new tools without changing core logic
- Support future platform changes with minimal refactoring
