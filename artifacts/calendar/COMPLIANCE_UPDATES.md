# Calendar Artifact React Compliance Updates

We've fixed several issues to improve code quality and React compliance in the calendar artifact components:

## Fixed Linter Errors

1. **Used `type` Keyword for Type-Only Imports**
   - In `CalendarContainer.tsx`, updated `import { ReactNode }` to `import type { ReactNode }` to indicate it's a type-only import

2. **Fixed Array Index Key Issue**
   - In `DatePicker.tsx`, replaced the default array index as a React key with a more unique key that includes the year and month: 
   ```tsx
   <div key={`empty-${currentMonth.getFullYear()}-${currentMonth.getMonth()}-start-${index}`} />
   ```

## Improved Code Organization

1. **Created Shared Utility Module**
   - Created `utils.ts` with the `calculateEndTime` function to avoid code duplication 
   - Updated both `DetailsForm.tsx` and `Confirmation.tsx` to use this shared utility

2. **Centralized Icon Components**
   - Created `CalendarIcons.tsx` with all SVG icon components
   - Removed duplicate icon components from individual files
   - Updated components to import from the shared icon file

3. **Removed Unused Type Exports**
   - Simplified `index.ts` to only export the components we need

## Standardized Component Pattern

1. **Consistent Icon Usage**
   - Using the Lucide React library for icons where appropriate
   - Otherwise using our shared icon components

2. **Applied Type Safety**
   - Ensured proper typing throughout component interfaces

## Benefits

These changes help us follow React best practices:

1. **Performance**: Proper React keys help with rendering optimization
2. **Maintainability**: Shared code is easier to update 
3. **Bundle Size**: Avoiding duplication reduces the bundle size
4. **Consistency**: Using the same patterns throughout the codebase makes it easier to understand

To continue compliance improvements, consider:

1. Using React's `useCallback` for event handlers
2. Adding proper `aria-*` attributes for accessibility 
3. Using the `memo` HOC for components that don't need frequent re-renders
4. Implementing proper error boundaries
