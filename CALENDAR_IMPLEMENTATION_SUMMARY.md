# Calendar Artifact UI Implementation Summary

## What We've Done

We've completely restructured the calendar artifact to create a more modular, maintainable, and visually consistent UI. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

### 1. Component Structure

We created a set of focused, reusable components:

- **CalendarContainer.tsx**: A wrapper component that handles loading states
- **DatePicker.tsx**: Date selection interface with month navigation
- **TimePicker.tsx**: Time slot selection interface with grid layout
- **DetailsForm.tsx**: Form for collecting meeting information
- **Confirmation.tsx**: Confirmation screen with meeting details

### 2. UI Improvements

- Replaced the black background with a theme-aware design
- Made the components match your app's existing design language
- Added responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Simplified the UI for better user experience

### 3. Code Quality

- Removed dependencies on external libraries like Lucide React
- Inlined SVG icons for better control and fewer dependencies
- Fixed linting errors, especially with array keys
- Improved typings and component interfaces

## How to Complete the Implementation

To finish implementing the calendar artifact UI:

1. Copy the provided sample code from `artifacts/calendar/README-implementation.md` to replace your current `artifacts/calendar/client.tsx` file
2. Test the implementation with your API endpoints and authentication flow
3. Make any necessary adjustments to the styling to match your application

## Benefits of the New Implementation

- **Modularity**: Each component handles one specific responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update or modify individual components
- **Consistency**: Visual design matches the rest of your application
- **Responsiveness**: Better layout across different screen sizes
- **Typings**: Improved type safety throughout the code

## Next Steps

After implementing these changes, you might want to:

1. Add animations for transitions between steps
2. Implement real API calls for calendar availability
3. Add more comprehensive error handling
4. Enhance accessibility features
