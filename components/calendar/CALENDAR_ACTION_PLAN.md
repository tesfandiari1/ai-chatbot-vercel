# Calendar Implementation Plan: Chat-based UI

> **Note**: This document is the single source of truth for the calendar implementation plan.

## OVERVIEW

Our calendar system allows users to book appointments on a company-owned calendar through a streamlined chat-based UI. The implementation follows a step-by-step flow from date selection to booking confirmation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User asks about appointment] --> B[AI recognizes intent]
    B --> C[AI tool fetches company calendar availability]
    C --> D[Date picker renders in chat]
    D --> E[Time slot picker renders in chat]
    E --> F[Appointment form renders in chat]
    F --> G[Booking confirmed in chat]
```

## KEY ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS

1. **Calendar Tools**
   - `getCalendarAvailability` - Initiates booking flow, returns available dates
   - `getAvailableTimeSlots` - Returns available time slots for a selected date
   - `prepareAppointmentForm` - Prepares form with selected date & time
   - `bookCalendarAppointment` - Books appointment with user details
   - `searchCalendarEvents` - Searches for existing appointments
   - `cancelCalendarEvent` - Cancels an existing appointment

2. **Calendar Components**
   - `DatePicker` - Interactive calendar for date selection
   - `TimePicker` - Time slot selection interface
   - `AppointmentForm` - Collects user details for booking
   - `Confirmation` - Booking confirmation details
   - `EventSearchResults` - Shows search results with cancel options

3. **Backend Integration**
   - API client for external calendar service
   - Caching layer for performance
   - Validation middleware for data verification

## INTERACTION FLOW

1. When a user asks to book an appointment, the AI calls `getCalendarAvailability`
2. The user selects a date using `DatePicker`, UI submits selection to AI
3. AI calls `getAvailableTimeSlots` to retrieve available slots for selected date
4. User selects a time slot using `TimePicker`, UI submits selection to AI
5. AI calls `prepareAppointmentForm` to prepare the booking form
6. User submits `AppointmentForm` with their details
7. AI calls `bookCalendarAppointment` to finalize the booking
8. Confirmation is shown to the user

## TROUBLESHOOTING PLAN

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Event Propagation Issues**
   - React's synthetic event system may not be properly propagating events
   - Calendar components might be capturing events but not properly communicating selections

2. **Form Submission Challenges**
   - UI components are not consistently submitting data to the AI
   - DOM selectors may not be finding the correct form elements

3. **Timing Problems**
   - Component rendering and selection might be happening before DOM is fully ready
   - Race conditions between state updates and form submissions

4. **AI SDK Integration Gaps**
   - Tool calling implementation may not be properly integrated with UI components
   - Context preservation between tool calls may be incomplete

   - Optimize render cycles in calendar components
   - Implement debouncing for rapid user interactions

This simplified approach focuses on core functionality while avoiding overengineering. We've successfully implemented modern React event handling and context management patterns that are compliant with React 19.

## BEST PRACTICES

1. **React/Next.js Integration**
   - Use React 19's features for improved event handling
   - Follow NextJS 15 best practices for component rendering
   - Implement proper hydration-safe component design

2. **Tool Implementation**
   - Follow AI SDK best practices for tool creation
   - Ensure consistent error handling patterns
   - Implement proper type safety throughout
   - Use explicit interfaces rather than type assertions
   - Structure tools with clear descriptions, parameter schemas, and execute functions
   - Maintain context between tool executions using applicationState

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Minimize re-renders in interactive calendar components
   - Implement appropriate loading states
   - Use efficient DOM interactions for form submissions

## ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

Required environment variables:
```
COMPOSIO_API_KEY=your_api_key
COMPOSIO_CONNECTION_ID=your_connection_id
COMPANY_CALENDAR_ID=company-calendar@example.com
```

## TESTING GUIDANCE

When testing the calendar booking flow:

1. **Component Interactions**:
   - Verify that clicking dates/times properly advances the flow
   - Check that form submissions trigger the next step
   - Test error scenarios and fallback mechanisms

2. **Context Preservation**:
   - Verify that selected dates persist between steps
   - Confirm appointment types are maintained throughout the flow
   - Check that form data is correctly passed to the booking tool

3. **Tool Execution**:
   - Monitor console logs for tool execution events
   - Verify proper tool sequence (getAvailability → getTimeSlots → prepareForm → book)
   - Test error handling when tools fail 

## POTENTIAL CALENDAR INTEGRATION ISSUES

While not directly related to our component interaction issues, here are some common calendar integration problems to be aware of:

1. **Availability Discrepancies**:
   - Time zone differences between user and calendar
   - Events marked as "Busy" vs "Free" in connected calendars
   - All-day events affecting availability calculations

2. **Time Zone Handling**:
   - Ensure consistent time zone handling across components
   - Consider user's local time zone vs. service calendar time zone
   - Handle daylight saving time transitions properly

3. **Calendar Service API Limitations**:
   - Rate limiting affecting availability data retrieval
   - API version compatibility issues
   - Authentication token expiration and renewal

## AI SDK COMPLIANCE

To ensure our calendar implementation properly integrates with the AI SDK, we need to address several requirements and fix existing linter issues:

### Required Tool Structure

Each calendar tool in our system should adhere to the AI SDK tool interface requirements:

1. **Tool Definition Elements**:
   - `description`: Clear explanation of what the tool does (✓ implemented)
   - `parameters`: Zod schema defining the expected parameters (✓ implemented)
   - `execute`: Async function to handle the tool call (✓ implemented)

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Use proper interfaces that extend AI SDK types
   - Avoid using `as any` type assertions
   - Provide consistent parameter types across all tools

### Linter Issues to Fix

Several linter errors exist in the `calendar-interface.ts` file that need to be addressed:

```typescript
// Current issue: Using 'state' which isn't in ToolExecutionOptions type
state: { previousSelections: context }

// Current issue: Using type assertion that bypasses type checking
applicationState: { previousSelections: context }
} as any);

// Current issue: Another type assertion
} as any, // Cast as any to avoid type error
```

### Required Fixes

1. **Create Proper Interfaces**:
   ```typescript
   export interface AISDKToolExecutionOptions {
     applicationState?: {
       previousSelections?: CalendarContext;
       [key: string]: any;
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Use Correct Property Names**:
   ```typescript
   // Use applicationState (the SDK's expected property) instead of state
   const result = await tool.execute(params, {
     applicationState: { previousSelections: context }
   });
   ```

3. **Fix Deprecated Functions**:
   - Use proper interfaces for all old functions re-exported for compatibility 
   - Ensure consistent parameter naming between old and new interfaces

### Context Preservation

Our calendar system must maintain context between steps to meet AI SDK requirements:

1. **Context Flow**:
   - Calendar tools extract context from previous responses
   - Context is stored consistently between steps
   - Each tool execution updates the shared context object

2. **Context Structure**:
   - `currentStep`: Tracks the current step in the booking flow
   - `selectedDate`: Preserves date selection across steps
   - `selectedTimeSlot`: Maintains time selection across steps
   - `appointmentType`: Ensures consistent appointment type 
   - `formData`: Stores user-entered appointment details
