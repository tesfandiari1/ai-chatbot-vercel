# shadcn/ui Components

This project uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for its UI components. shadcn/ui is a collection of reusable components built on top of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Key Features

- **Accessibility**: Components are built on top of Radix UI, ensuring proper accessibility.
- **Customization**: All components are fully customizable with Tailwind CSS.
- **Themeable**: Supports both light and dark modes.
- **Type-safe**: Written in TypeScript with full type safety.

## Component Architecture

shadcn/ui components follow a specific architecture:

1. **Base Component**: Typically built with Radix UI primitives.
2. **Styling**: Applied with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
3. **Variants**: Often implemented using [Class Variance Authority (cva)](https://cva.style/docs).

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm">
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Available Components

This Storybook documents the following shadcn/ui components used in our project:

- Button
- Card
- Input
- Textarea
- Select
- Alert Dialog
- Dropdown Menu
- Separator
- Sheet
- Tooltip
- ... and more

## Theming

The components support both light and dark modes. In Storybook, you can toggle between themes using the theme selector in the toolbar.

Each component is styled using CSS variables defined in our `app/globals.css` file, which allows for consistent theming across the application.

## Adding New Components

When adding new shadcn/ui components to the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the component using the shadcn CLI
2. Create a story file in the same directory as the component
3. Document all variants and use cases
4. Add proper accessibility information
