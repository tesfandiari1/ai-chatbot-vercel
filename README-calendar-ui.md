# Calendar Artifact UI Refinement Plan

This document outlines the strategy for refining the calendar artifact UI to make it consistent with other editors in the application.

## Current Issues

- **Inconsistent Visual Design**: The calendar uses a black background with white text, while other components use a more subtle color scheme
- **Component Organization**: All UI rendering is in one large component with nested render functions
- **Responsiveness and Layout**: The calendar UI doesn't handle different viewport sizes well

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Component Separation**: Break down the monolithic calendar artifact into smaller, focused components
2. **Visual Consistency**: Align the UI with the application's design language
3. **Code Organization**: Create a consistent file structure following the pattern used by other artifacts
4. **Reusability**: Extract common UI elements into reusable components

## File Structure

```
artifacts/
  calendar/
    components/
      index.ts                 # Export all components
      CalendarContainer.tsx    # Main container component
      DatePicker.tsx           # Date selection step
      TimePicker.tsx           # Time slot selection step
      DetailsForm.tsx          # Meeting details form
      Confirmation.tsx         # Confirmation step
    client.tsx (update)        # Main artifact file (to be updated)
    types.ts (existing)        # Type definitions (existing)
    server.ts (existing)       # Server-side code (existing)
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the component structure and files
2. Update the main client.tsx file to use the new components
3. Ensure visual consistency with the app's design language
4. Test in both light and dark modes
5. Add responsive design improvements
6. Enhance accessibility

## Component Design Guidelines

- Use neutral backgrounds (white in light mode, dark gray in dark mode)
- Apply consistent border radius and shadows across components
- Follow the application's color theme for interactive elements
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment between elements
- Make all components responsive and accessible

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Test the component in different environments
2. Add animations for transitions between steps
3. Improve accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
4. Consider adding more advanced calendar features
